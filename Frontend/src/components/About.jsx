        <span className='text-pink-500 font-bold text-5xl'>About Us</span>
        <br/>
        <p className='mt-10'>
            There is nothing to know about us , or i would say there is nothing to know about <span className='text-primary'>"me"</span>. I am making this BookStore project as my second mern project and i am enjoying my time writing React. Tomorrow is my DSA quiz and i do not feel like studying for it. Web Development is quite fun when things start getting smooth. See ya in next project!
